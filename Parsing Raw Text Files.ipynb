    "In this assignment we extract data from semi-structured text file. The document contains contains information about several units in the Monash University. Each observation contains information about the unit, e.g., unit\n",
    "code, unit title, synopsis, requirements, output, chief examiner, etc. There are a total of 400 unit observation in a 2.27 MB file named `29498724.txt`. The task is to extract the data, wrangle it to the right format and transform the data into the `XML` and `JSON` format with the following elements:\n",
    "1. Unit code: is a 7-character string (three uppercase letter followed by 4 digits).\n",
    "2. Pre-requisites: only the unit codes of the units that are pre-requisite + co-requisite for the current unit (‘NA’ if the value is Null).\n",
    "3. Prohibitions: only the unit codes of the units that are prohibited to be taken with the current unit (‘NA’ if the value is Null).\n",
    "4. Synopsis: a string containing the synopsis of the unit (‘NA’ if the value is Null)\n",
    "5. Requirements: the list of requirements of the current unit (‘NA’ if the value is Null).\n",
    "6. Outputs: the list of outputs of the current unit (‘NA’ if the value is Null).\n",
    "7. Chief-examiners: the list of the chief-examiners of the current unit (‘TBA’ if Null).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is followed as follows:\n",
    "1. Extract each unit information and store the list with each unit observation as an element.\n",
    "2. Extract all the described categories for each unit and store the information in a dictionary.\n",
    "3. All of the unit information is stored in a list of dictionary. e.g., Units[{unit1},{unit2}....{unit400}].\n",
    "4. Complete output is stored as a key-value pair in a dictionary format to transform it to `JSON` format.\n",
    "5. The final dictionary is then converted to `XML` by appending the respective tags. \n",
    "6. Store the `JSON` result into a `29498724.json` file and the `XML` result into a `29498724.xml` file.\n",
